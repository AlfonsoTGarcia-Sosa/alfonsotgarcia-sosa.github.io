<small>Abstract:</small>
<br>
Drug-target binding affinity and pharmacokinetics are equally important factors of drug design. 
Simple molecular properties such as molecular size have been used as pharmacokinetic and/or drug-likeness filters during chemical library design and also correlated with binding affinity. 
In the present study, current property filters are reviewed, a collection of their optimal values is provided, and a statistical framework is introduced allowing calibration of their selectivity and sensitivity for drugs. 
The role of ligand efficiency indices in drug design is also described. 
It is concluded that the usefulness of property filters of molecular size and lipophilicity is limited as predictors of general drug-likeness. 
However, they demonstrate increased performance in specific cases, <em>e.g.</em> in central nervous system diseases, emphasizing their future importance in specific, disease-focused library design instead of general drug-likeness filtering.

We used ligand binding efficiencies in virtual screening, together with anti-targets composing several proteins involved in compound metabolism, in order to discover candidate compounds for wild-type and drug-resistant HIV-1 reverse transcriptases that have the best profiles, both for binding to a variety of targets (target proteins in several conformational, mutational, and hydration states), as well as their predicted interaction profile with PXR, SULT, and several CYPs.

<small>Abstract:</small>
<br>
New hits against HIV-1 wild-type and Y181C drug-resistant reverse transcriptases were predicted taking into account the possibility of some of the known metabolism interactions. 
In silico hits against a set of antitargets (<em>i.e.</em>, proteins or nucleic acids that are off-targets from the desired pharmaceutical target objective) are used to predict a simple, visual measure of possible interactions for the ligands, which helps to introduce early safety considerations into the design of compounds before lead optimization. 
This combined approach consists of consensus docking and scoring: cross-docking to a group of wild-type and drug-resistant mutant proteins, ligand efficiency (also called binding efficiency) indices as new ranking measures, pre- and postdocking filters, a set of antitargets and estimation, and minimization of atomic clashes. 
Diverse, small-molecule compounds with new chemistry (such as a triazine core with aromatic side chains) as well as known drugs for different applications (oxazepam, chlorthalidone) were highly ranked to the targets having binding interactions and functional group spatial arrangements similar to those of known inhibitors, while being moderate to low binders to the antitargets. 
The results are discussed on the basis of their relevance to medicinal and computational chemistry. 
Optimization of ligands to targets and off-targets or antitargets is foreseen to be critical for compounds directed at several simultaneous sites.

<h3>Chemically Relevant Functional Group Substitutions of a Tightly-Bound Water Molecule Including Enthalpic, Entropic, Fully Explicit Solvent and Ground State Effects</h3>

New, modified ligands for the Abl tyrosine kinase-SH3 domain implicated in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML, a cancer of white blood cells) were built by generating different scenarios: including, neglecting, and targeting a specific hydration site with several chemical functional groups. This enabled determining the thermodynamic and structural effects of these chemical probes in a protein-ligand complex that has a tightly-bound water molecule bridging the interaction. Molecular dynamics using thermodynamic integration (a relative of the free energy perturbation method), explicit water, periodic boundary conditions, full thermodynamic cycles to include the desolvation effects of ligands as well as of the individual water molecule, and correcting for the ground state provides valuable information on the different groups that are best suited chemically and physically for substitution. Some water molecules are loosely bound to the protein or ligand surface, and so will not interfere or interact strongly. However, there are some which will be strongly bound and can be distinguished in several complexed states of the protein (see WaterScore below). This paper shows the different routes available for modification of the ligand structure based on a strongly-bound water, and their effects and insight into ligand optimization of protein&ndash;ligand&ndash;water systems.

<small>Abstract:</small>
<br>
The accurate calculation of the free energy of interaction of protein&ndash;water&ndash;ligand systems has an important role in molecular recognition and drug design that is often not fully considered. 
We report free energy thermodynamic integration calculations used to evaluate the effects of inclusion, neglect, and targeting and removal (<em>i.e.</em>, systematic substitution by ligand functional groups) of an important, tightly bound, water molecule in the SH3 domain of Abl tyrosine kinase. 
The effects of this water molecule on the free energies of interaction of several Abl-SH3 domain-ligand systems reveal that there is an unfavourable free energy change associated with its removal into the bulk solvent. 
Only three substitutions by an additional functional group (out of methyl, ethyl, hydroxyl, amino, and amide groups) in the phenyl ring of a tyrosine in the peptide ligand resulted in a favourable change in the free energy of binding upon replacement of the ordered water molecule. 
This computational approach provides a direct route to the systematic and rigorous prediction of the thermodynamic influence of ordered, structural water molecules on ligand modification and optimization in drug design by calculating free energy changes in protein&ndash;water&ndash;ligand systems.

<h3>Ligand and drug efficiency indices (EI)</h3>

Efficiency indices effectively normalize the free energy of binding of a drug or ligand
per a given measure of that compound's molecular characteristics, such as molecular weight or number of heavy atoms.
 Particular ligand efficiencies were determined to improve the correlation between experimental and calculated EI values for protein-drug complexes.
 &Delta;G/W (free energy of binding divided by Wiener index, a topological measure), &Delta;G/NoC (free energy of binding divided by number of carbons, a measure of size and lipophilicity), and &Delta;G/P (free energy of binding divided by the octanol / water partition coefficent, a measure of lipophilicity and hydrophilicity) produced improved correlations for EI for several docking programs and scoring functions. 
Better correlations between experimental and calculated EI values can improve the accuracy of virtual screening and molecular docking.
 In addition, the common bias of scoring functions in favor of larger ligands can be removed.

<small>Abstract:</small>
<br>
A dataset of protein-drug complexes with experimental binding energy and crystal structure were analyzed and the performance of different docking engines and scoring functions (as well as components of these) for predicting the free energy of binding and several ligand efficiency indices were compared. 
The aim was not to evaluate the best docking method, but to determine the effect of different efficiency indices on the experimental and predicted free energy. 
Some ligand efficiency indices, such as &Delta;G/W (Wiener index), &Delta;G/NoC (number of carbons), and &Delta;G/P (partition coefficient), improve the correlation between experimental and calculated values. 
This effect was shown to be valid across the different scoring functions and docking programs. 
It also removes the common bias of scoring functions in favor of larger ligands. 
Compound collection filtering can be done prior or after docking, using pharmacokinetic as well as pharmacodynamic profiles. 
Achieving these better correlations with experiment can improve the ability of docking scoring functions to predict active molecules in virtual screening.

<h3>Inhibitor design targeting H5N1 avian influenza</h3>

Drug design was conducted together with virtual screening for generating inhibitors that
simultaneously occupy several binding sites of both wild-type
H5N1 avian influenza neuraminidase, as well as of a drug-resistant mutant.
Several ligand efficiency (also called binding efficiency) values were
used to better characterize the compounds.

<small>Abstract:</small>
<br>
The binding sites of wild-type avian influenza A H5N1 neuraminidase, as well as those of the Tamiflu (oseltamivir)-resistant H274Y variant, were explored computationally to design inhibitors that target simultaneously several adjacent binding sites of the open conformation of the virus protein. 
The compounds with the best computed free energies of binding, in agreement by two docking methods, consensus scoring, and ligand efficiency values, suggest that mimicking a polysaccharide, &beta;-lactam, and other structures, including known drugs, could be routes for multibinding site inhibitor design. 
This new virtual screening method based on consensus scoring and ligand efficiency indices is introduced, which allows the combination of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties into unique measures.

<h3>Drug design with metalloproteins, zinc centres and multiple molecular dynamics simulations</h3>

Small molecule inhibitors of Botulinum neurotoxin
 serotype A (BoNTA) were designed using multiple molecular dynamics simulations (MMDS)
  and a non-bonded four coordination active site zinc model,
   as well as projects on protein-ligand free energy of binding and other
    thermodynamic analyses of multiple protein-ligand systems.
    <br><br>
    The use of 20 molecular dynamics simulations
    of at least 2 ns in explicit solvent
    results in
     improved sampling that provides a good measure to discriminate if a ligand
     in a given binding mode has favourable interactions inside a binding site,
     with the best
      ligands remaining in a strong coordination to the protein and having favourable interaction energy terms.

<small>Abstract:</small>
<br>
Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNTA) is one of the most toxic substances known. 
Currently, there is no antidote to BoNTA. 
Small molecules identified from high-throughput screening reportedly inhibit the endopeptidase &ndash; the zinc-bound, catalytic domain of BoNTA &ndash; at a drug concentration of 20 &micro;M. 
However, optimization of these inhibitors is hampered by challenges including the computational evaluation of the ability of a zinc ligand to compete for coordination with nearby residues in the active site of BoNTA. 
No improved inhibitor of the endopeptidase has been reported. 
This article reports the development of a serotype-selective, small-molecule inhibitor of BoNTA with a K<sub><em>i</em></sub> of 12 &micro;M. 
This inhibitor was designed to coordinate the zinc ion embedded in the active site of the enzyme for affinity and to interact with a species-specific residue in the active site for selectivity. 
It is the most potent small-molecule inhibitor of BoNTA reported to date. 
The results suggest that multiple molecular dynamics simulations using the cationic dummy atom approach are useful to structure-based design of zinc protease inhibitors.

<h3>Explicit, crystallographic water molecules in computer-aided drug design</h3>

Hydration of protein-substrate/inhibitor 
complexes is a factor involved in the design of ligands. 
Water molecules have a very important role in the 
molecular recognition process as well as in the overall thermodynamics of
protein-ligand binding and 
biomolecular processes. Therefore, dynamic simulation studies of proteins 
in an aqueous environment are critical for a realistic description of their 
structure and thermodynamic properties. 
A study of both the structural and dynamical properties of these systems 
proves useful to understand ligand&ndash;binding phenomena.<br><br>

A first step in
these studies was a comprehensive survey of patterns in
hydration sites as seen in the crystal structures of sets of proteins of interest.

A multivariate function
was developed to fit the properties of the water molecules observed both in the X
ray crystal structures of the active sites of <em>apo</em> 
proteins and in the structure of the
actives sites of complexes of the same proteins, to distinguish them from  
the properties of those water molecules not matched between sites. 
These comparisons were carried out for a variety of proteins. 
The predicted outcome variable (called WaterScore value) may be used to assign 
the probability of observing a particular water molecule from the <em>apo</em> 
protein structure in a structure of a complex of that protein, provided that 
it is not displaced sterically by the ligand or by a protein conformational 
change. The group of water molecules used in the analysis are those in the 
hydration shell of the ligand in the complex structure of the protein. 
This is interesting for drug design, docking strategies and methods
because it allows the inclusion of a set of explicit water molecules, since
the bound water molecules can be scored very easily and fast. 
The inclusion of specific water molecules allows for a better description of protein-ligand binding and improves the calculation of binding poses, intermolecular interactions and binding energy.

<br>
We have performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis to establish a statistical correlation between the structural properties of water molecules in
the binding site of a free protein crystal structure, with the probability of observing the water molecules in the same location in the crystal structure of the ligand&ndash;complexed form. 
The temperature B-factor, the solvent-contact surface area, the total hydrogen bond energy, and the number of protein-water contacts were found to discriminate between bound and displaceable water molecules in the best regression functions obtained. 
These functions may be used to identify those bound water molecules that should be included in structure-based drug design and ligand docking algorithms.

Tightly-bound water molecules were also found to to be neccessary to explain 
pharmacophore binding model projection points. This showed that active ligands used
tightly bound water molecules as interaction groups inside protein binding sites.

<small>Abstract:</small>
<br>
The importance of the consideration of water molecules in the structural interpretation of ligand-derived pharmacophore models is explored. 
We compare and combine results from recently introduced methods for bound-water molecule identification in protein binding sites and ligand-superposition-based pharmacophore derivation, for the interpretation of ligand-derived pharmacophore models. 
In the analysis of thymidine kinase (HSV-1) and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), the concurrent application of both methods leads to an agreement in the prediction of tightly bound water molecules as key pharmacophoric points in the binding site of these proteins. 
This agreement has implications for approaching binding site analysis and consensus drug design, as it highlights how pharmacophore-based models of binding sites can include interaction features not only with protein groups but also with bound water molecules.

<small>Abstract:</small>
<br>
Different strategies for the in silico generation of ligand molecules in the binding site of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) were studied in order to observe the effect of the targeting and displacement of tightly bound water molecules. 
Several molecular scaffolds were identified as having better interactions in the binding site when targeting one or two tightly bound water molecules in the NAD binding site. 
Energy calculations were conducted in order to assess the ligand&ndash;protein and ligand&ndash;water&ndash;protein interactions of different functional groups of the generated ligands. 
These calculations were used to evaluate the energetic consequences of the presence of tightly bound water molecules and to identify those that contribute favorably to the binding of ligands.

<small>Abstract:</small>
<br>
We have determined the effects that tightly bound water molecules have on the de novo design of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2) ligands. 
In particular, we have analyzed the impact of a specific structural water molecule on the chemical diversity and binding mode of ligands generated through a de novo structure-based ligand generation method in the binding site of CDK2. 
The tightly bound water molecule modifies the size and shape of the binding site and we have found that it also imposed constraints on the observed binding modes of the generated ligands. 
This in turn had the indirect effect of reducing the chemical diversity of the underlying molecular scaffolds that were able to bind to the enzyme satisfactorily.

<small>Abstract:</small>
<br>
The lowest energy structures of FeO<sub>2</sub> were determined by means of density functional theory techniques as implemented in the program DGauss 3.0.1. 
The calculations performed were of the all-electron type using two levels of theory, namely the local spin density approximation with the use of the Vosko&ndash;Wilk&ndash;Nusair (VWN) functional and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of the Becke (1988) exchange and Perdew (1986) correlation functionals. 
Results were visualized with UniChem. 
Bond distances and angles as well as total energies were calculated for several states of the moieties: Fe(O)<sub>2</sub>, <em>C</em><sub>2<em>v</em></sub>; Fe(O)<sub>2</sub>, <em>D</em><sub>&infin;<em>h</em></sub>; Fe(&eta;<sup>2</sup>-O<sub>2</sub>), <em>C</em><sub>2<em>v</em></sub>; Fe(&eta;<sup>1</sup>-O<sub>2</sub>), <em>C</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>; and Fe(&eta;<sup>1</sup>-O<sub>2</sub>), <em>C</em><sub>&infin;<em>v</em></sub>. 
Molecular orbital and harmonic vibrational analyses were carried out for these species, in addition to Mulliken population analyses. 
Singly positive and negative charged species were also considered and fully geometry optimized in a self-consistent field (SCF) gradient method. 
Accurate ionization potentials and electron affinities (both vertical, <em>v</em>, and adiabatic, <em>a</em>, determinations) were thus able to be computed. 
The results show the following for the ground state (GS) Fe(O)<sub>2</sub>, <em>C</em><sub>2<em>v</em></sub>, <em>M</em>=3: &ang;OFeO=138.1&deg; (133.6&deg;) [values in parentheses are for local spin density approximation (LSDA)&ndash;VWN, while the others are at the GGA-B88/P86 level]. 
Here, <em>R</em><sub><em>e</em></sub> Fe&ndash;O=1.60 &Aring; (1.57 &Aring;), ET=&minus;1414.2064 au (&minus;1,410.5047 au), EA<sub><em>a</em></sub>=2.47 (2.60) eV, IP<sub><em>a</em></sub>=10.6 (10.5) eV, EA<sub><em>v</em></sub>=2.41 (2.20) eV, IP<sub><em>v</em></sub>=10.67 (10.63) eV, and EA<sub>exp</sub>=2.349 eV (in agreement with related studies). 
In the GS the dioxygen molecule is found to be dissociated, compared to those states which have coordination modes where the O<sub>2</sub> molecule formally persists. 
A 3<em>d</em>4<em>sp</em> configuration for the iron atom is found to be especially relevant in Fe&ndash;O bond formation. 
The iron&ndash;oxygen and oxygen&ndash;oxygen bonds involved are characterized. 
A direct relationship is observed between these electronic and structural properties, influencing also the total energy for a given molecule.
